# Shmøergh A1 — Semi-modular analog monosynth

A1 is a fully analog semi-modular monosynth. I took the Minimoog as my main inspiration for its sound but of course the circuitry is nowhere comparable with it. The synth has a default hardwired patch inside, it has a couple of modulation sources and targets so we can consider it semi-modular. Everything is handmade by me at home. Most of the module circuits are based on very well-known schematics and a few of the circuits are original.

### Features
- Fat AF analog sound, fun
- Two voices with 3 waveshapes (saw, triangle, pulse) and additional noise and square suboscillator sound sources
- 24dB/oct diode low pass filter with self-resonance and dedicated envelope generator
- Triangle and square waveform LFO
- Mod matrix for overriding default patch
- Follows Eurorack standards: 10Vpp signal and modulation, 0-8V envelope levels
- All modules are designed and built on separate PCBs for reusability and experimenting

### What's in this repo?
You can find all the **KiCad 5** files (schematics and PCB design) of the synth here.
